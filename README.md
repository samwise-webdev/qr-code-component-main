## My process

- Identify the different components that probably make up the final design
- Begin to break down the HTML into those parts
- Create CSS Stylesheet while braking down HTML

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I had some difficulty getting things to align/justify properly so I moved around the justify-content, display: flex;, and align-items properties around a few times and looked for some help on the internet on how to make those work as I wanted them to.

### Continued development

- It is important for me to continue practicing with flexbox because there are still a lot of nuances that I don't fully understand with it.

### Useful resources

- I have been using Colt Steele's Web Dev Bootcamp to learn HTML/CSS and will be starting on JavaScript soon. It has been very helpful (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)
